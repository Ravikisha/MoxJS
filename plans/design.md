# 🧠 Phase 0 – Architecture & Design (2–3 Weeks)

## ✅ Core Decisions

* [ ] Choose bundler core:

  * [x] Rspack (fastest + MF support)
  * [ ] OR Turbopack (experimental)
  * [ ] OR Webpack 5 (stable, safe for MVP)

* [ ] Define:

  * [ ] Federation abstraction layer
  * [ ] Dev server orchestration model
  * [ ] Config system (`mfjs.config.ts`)
  * [ ] Plugin system architecture

* [ ] Define monorepo strategy:

  * [x] Native workspaces
  * [ ] Nx integration?
  * [ ] Custom workspace manager?

* [ ] Define routing abstraction:

  * [ ] React Router wrapper
  * [ ] File-based routing compiler *(removed from examples — was broken, needs rework)*

* [ ] Define communication model:

  * [x] Built-in EventBus
  * [x] Optional global store (Redux/Zustand)

* [ ] Design manifest format for orchestration:

```json
{
  "name": "dashboard",
  "routes": ["/dashboard/*"],
  "exposes": ["DashboardApp"],
  "remoteEntry": "http://localhost:3001/remoteEntry.js"
}
```

---

# 🏗 Phase 1 – MVP (v0.1) – 8–10 Weeks

Goal: **Create multi-MFE app in minutes**

---

## 1️⃣ CLI System (Weeks 1–3)

### CLI Core

* [x] Create `mfjs` CLI (Node + Commander)
* [ ] Commands:

  * [x] `mfjs init`
  * [x] `mfjs generate host`
  * [x] `mfjs generate remote`
  * [x] `mfjs dev` (basic: runs all `apps/*` dev servers)
  * [x] `mfjs build` (basic: runs all `apps/*` builds)

### Scaffolding

* [x] Template engine (minimal, code-generated)
* [x] Generate:

  * [x] Monorepo structure (pnpm workspace)
  * [x] Host shell (Rspack + React starter)
  * [x] One remote (Rspack + React starter)
  * [x] Shared libs folder (libs/ui, libs/state, libs/event-bus)

### Folder Structure Generator

```
apps/
  shell/
  dashboard/
libs/
  ui/
  state/
  event-bus/
```

### Tests needed

* [x] `mfjs init` — assert scaffolded workspace has correct `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `apps/` and `libs/` directories
* [x] `mfjs generate host` — assert `apps/shell/` created with `index.html`, `rspack.config.mjs`, `src/main.tsx`, `mfjs.app.json`
* [x] `mfjs generate remote` — assert `apps/dashboard/` created with correct `remoteEntry` expose in `mfjs.federation.json`
* [x] `mfjs dev` — assert spawns one process per app and exits cleanly on `SIGINT`
* [x] `mfjs build` — assert both apps produce `dist/index.html` and `dist/main.js`

---

## 2️⃣ Module Federation Automation (Weeks 3–5)

* [x] Create federation config generator (`mfjs federation`)

* [x] Auto-detect:

  * [x] app name
  * [x] exposed components
  * [x] shared dependencies

* [x] Auto-generate:

  * [x] host federation config (`mfjs.federation.json` with `remotes`)
  * [x] remote federation config (`mfjs.federation.json` with `exposes`)

* [x] Shared singleton logic:

  * [x] React (singleton + eager)
  * [x] ReactDOM (singleton + eager)
  * [ ] Router *(not yet shared via federation — needs design)*
  * [x] EventBus (singleton)

* [x] Dynamic remote loading (`loadRemoteModule`) — `libs/runtime/src/remote-loader.ts`

* [x] Share-scope init (Rspack-native `__federation_init_sharing__` + webpack shim in `index.html`)

### Tests needed

* [x] `loadRemoteEntry` — assert script tag injected into `document.head` with correct `src`
* [x] `loadRemoteEntry` — assert deduplication: calling twice does not inject two scripts
* [x] `loadRemoteEntry` — assert rejects when remote container global is never assigned
* [x] `initRemoteContainer` — assert calls `__federation_init_sharing__` first, then `container.init()` with live scope
* [x] `initRemoteContainer` — assert falls back to webpack path when Rspack globals absent
* [x] `loadRemoteModule` — assert returns `factory()` result from container `.get()`
* [x] `loadRemoteModule` — assert throws with clear message when remote spec is missing `@`
* [x] Federation config generator — assert output JSON has correct `name`, `exposes`, `remotes`, `shared` shape
* [x] Federation config generator — assert `react` and `react-dom` always have `singleton: true`

---

## 3️⃣ Dev Server Orchestration (Weeks 5–7)

* [x] Unified `mfjs dev`
* [x] Concurrent process runner (spawns `rspack serve` per app)
* [x] Auto-proxy remotes (`/mfjs/remotes/<name>/remoteEntry.js` → `http://localhost:<port>`)
* [x] HMR across shell + remotes
* [x] Source maps
* [ ] On-demand compilation *(infrastructure exists but not verified end-to-end)*

Stretch:

* [x] Fast rebuild detection (Rspack incremental)
* [ ] Watch workspace changes

### Tests needed

* [x] `mfjs dev` — assert proxy rule created for each remote listed in host `mfjs.federation.json`
* [x] `mfjs dev` — assert host defaults to port 3000, first remote defaults to port 3001
* [x] `mfjs dev` — assert missing `mfjs.federation.json` triggers auto-generation before starting servers
* [x] `mfjs dev` — assert `SIGINT` terminates all child processes cleanly
* [x] Dev server proxy — assert `GET /mfjs/remotes/dashboard/remoteEntry.js` forwards to `http://localhost:3001/remoteEntry.js`

---

## 4️⃣ Routing Engine (Weeks 7–8)

### Shell

* [x] Auto-generate shell router *(shell `main.tsx` uses `createRouter` + `resolveRoute` against `HOST_ROUTES`)*
* [x] Map MFEs to base paths *(`HOST_ROUTES` maps `/` and `/dashboard/*` → dashboard remote)*

### Remotes

* [x] File-based routing support *(`src/pages/` — `index.tsx`, `settings.tsx`, `users/[id].tsx`; exposed via `./Routes`)*
* [x] Auto-register pages *(`mfjs.routes.ts` exports `pages: RemotePageRoute[]`; `remote.tsx` calls `resolveRemotePage`)*

### Cross-App Navigation

* [x] `mfjs:navigate` custom event dispatched via `dispatchMfjsNavigate()`
* [x] `createRouter` — shell listener that converts `mfjs:navigate` events into `history.pushState`
* [x] `resolveRoute(routes, pathname)` — matches `RouteTarget[]` against a pathname with params/splat
* [x] `matchPath(pattern, pathname)` — low-level matcher supporting static, `:param`, `*` splat
* [x] Integration of routing into the example app *(shell routes via `createRouter`; remote renders file-based pages via `resolveRemotePage`)*

### Tests needed

* [x] `matchPath` — static segment match / mismatch
* [x] `matchPath` — `:param` extraction
* [x] `matchPath` — `*` splat captures remaining segments
* [x] `matchPath` — root `/` only matches exact root
* [x] `matchPath` — trailing slash normalisation
* [x] `resolveRoute` — returns first matching target with params
* [x] `resolveRoute` — returns `null` when no route matches
* [x] `createRouter.navigate` — assert `history.pushState` called and subscribers notified
* [x] `createRouter.subscribe` — assert callback fires with current path immediately on subscribe
* [x] `createRouter.navigate replace` — assert `history.replaceState` called instead of push
* [x] `createRouter.destroy` — assert `popstate` listener removed after destroy
* [x] `createRouter` basePath — assert events only fire when path starts with basePath
* [x] `dispatchMfjsNavigate` — assert `mfjs:navigate` CustomEvent dispatched on `window`
* [x] `resolveRemotePage` — assert correct page module returned for matching subpath with params
* [x] `resolveRemotePage` — assert `null` returned when no page matches subpath

---

## 5️⃣ Communication Layer (Week 8–9)

* [x] Build lightweight EventBus (`libs/event-bus/src/index.ts`)
* [x] Singleton injection (shared via MF `@mfjs/event-bus: { singleton: true }`)
* [x] Publish/Subscribe API (`on`, `emit`)
* [x] Typed event contracts (generic `EventBus<Events extends EventMap>`)

Optional:

* [x] Shared Redux store template

### Tests needed

* [x] `EventBus.on` + `emit` — assert handler receives correct payload
* [x] `EventBus.on` — assert returned unsubscribe fn removes the handler
* [x] `EventBus.emit` — assert no error when no handlers registered
* [x] `EventBus` — assert two separate instances do NOT share events (proves singleton must be configured correctly in MF)
* [x] `EventBus` — assert TypeScript prevents emitting unknown event keys (compile-time test via `tsc --noEmit`)
* [x] Cross-MFE EventBus — e2e: shell emits event, remote handler receives it via shared singleton

---

## 6️⃣ Build System (Week 9–10)

* [x] Production build pipeline (`mfjs build` → `rspack build` per app)
* [x] Chunk splitting (Rspack default code splitting)
* [x] Content hashing (Rspack `output.filename` with `[contenthash]`)
* [ ] Gzip/Brotli support *(not configured)*
* [x] Output `remoteEntry.js` (via `ModuleFederationPlugin.filename`)

### Tests needed

* [x] `mfjs build` — assert `dist/remoteEntry.js` exists in remote output
* [x] `mfjs build` — assert `dist/index.html` references correct `main.[hash].js`
* [x] `mfjs build` — assert shell `dist/` does NOT bundle React separately (singleton sharing works in production build)
* [x] `mfjs build` — assert remote `dist/remoteEntry.js` exposes `./App` container

---

# 🎯 MVP Deliverable

You should be able to run:

```bash
mfjs init my-app
mfjs generate host shell --remotes=dashboard
mfjs dev
```

And see:

* Shell mounted
* Remote (`./App`) loaded via `loadRemoteModule`
* HMR working
* No duplicate React (singleton share-scope working)

---

# 🧩 Phase 2 – Beta (v0.5) – 10–12 Weeks

---

## SSR / SSG (Weeks 1–4)

* [ ] Server rendering host
* [ ] Remote SSR compatibility
* [ ] Streaming SSR
* [ ] Static export support
* [ ] Edge adapter interface

---

## TypeScript Integration (Week 2–3)

* [x] Strict TS config — `tsconfig.base.json` at monorepo root; all packages extend it; 7 strict flags beyond `strict: true`
* [x] Shared types package — `@mfjs/types` (zero-runtime): app config, federation config, federation contracts, routing types
* [x] Typed federation contracts — `defineFederationContract`, `InferExposed/Emits/Listens`, `validateFederationContract`, `mfjs typecheck` CLI command
* [x] Typed EventBus *(generic `EventBus<Events>` implemented)*

---

## CI/CD Automation (Weeks 4–6)

* [x] Generate GitHub Actions template — `mfjs ci generate` scaffolds `ci.yml`, `pr-preview.yml`, `deploy.yml`
* [x] Affected builds detection — `mfjs ci affected [--base <ref>] [--head <ref>] [--format json]`
* [x] Parallel remote builds — `ci.yml` build job uses affected detection + `mfjs build` per app
* [x] CDN deployment example — `buildDeployWorkflow` supports `netlify` / `s3`+CloudFront / `azure`
* [x] PR preview deployment template — `mfjs ci preview` scaffolds `pr-preview.yml` with Netlify + GitHub PR comment

---

## Performance System (Weeks 6–8)

* [ ] Bundle size analyzer
* [ ] Performance budgets
* [ ] Warning system
* [ ] Lazy loading enforcement
* [ ] Image optimization plugin

---

## Error Handling & Resilience (Weeks 8–9)

* [ ] Error boundaries auto-injection
* [ ] Offline cache support

---

# 🧠 Recommended Development Order (Critical Advice)

Because you are a **systems-level thinker building frameworks**, follow this order strictly:

1. CLI + federation auto-generation ✅
2. Dev server orchestration ✅
3. Routing ✅ *(shell `createRouter` + remote `resolveRemotePage` + file-based pages integrated in example)*
4. Communication layer ✅
5. Build system ✅
6. Then SSR

⚠️ DO NOT start with SSR or visual tools.

# 👨‍💻 Team Structure (If Scaling)

| Role                 | Responsibility       |
| -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Core Architect (You) | Bundler + Federation |
| DX Engineer          | CLI + Dev Server     |
| Runtime Engineer     | SSR + Routing        |
| Tooling Engineer     | CI/CD + Performance  |

---

# 📈 Risk Areas

* Module Federation version mismatches *(share-scope shim needed — implemented in `index.html`)*
* HMR across multiple remotes *(lazy-compilation-proxy crashes fixed — `lazyCompilation: false` applied)*
* SSR + MF complexity
* Dev server race conditions
* Edge runtime compatibility

---

# 🎯 Final Honest Assessment

This is:

* Bigger than Relax.js
* Comparable to early Nx
* Very publishable as:

  * OSS project
  * Conference paper
  * Startup foundation

If executed well, this could become:

> “Next.js for Micro Frontends”

# 🧪 Test Coverage Plan

This section tracks the full test spec for every implemented feature. Tests marked `[x]` already exist in the codebase.

---

## `loadRemoteEntry` / `initRemoteContainer` / `loadRemoteModule`

| Status | Test |
|--------|------|
| [x] | `loadRemoteEntry` — script tag injected into `document.head` with correct `src` |
| [x] | `loadRemoteEntry` — deduplication: calling twice with same URL injects only one script tag |
| [x] | `loadRemoteEntry` — rejects with timeout error when container global never appears |
| [x] | `initRemoteContainer` — calls `__federation_init_sharing__('default')` first (Rspack path) |
| [x] | `initRemoteContainer` — calls `container.init()` with the live scope object |
| [x] | `initRemoteContainer` — falls back to `__webpack_init_sharing__` when Rspack globals absent |
| [x] | `initRemoteContainer` — safe to call multiple times (idempotent) |
| [x] | `loadRemoteModule` — returns the module exported by `factory()` from container `.get()` |
| [x] | `loadRemoteModule` — throws a clear error when `remoteUrl` resolves to wrong container name |

---

## `matchPath`

| Status | Test |
|--------|------|
| [x] | static segment `/about` matches `/about` |
| [x] | static segment `/about` does not match `/about/team` |
| [x] | `:param` pattern `/users/:id` extracts `{ id }` from `/users/42` |
| [x] | `*` splat captures everything after prefix |
| [x] | root `/` only matches `/` and not `/anything` |
| [x] | trailing slash normalisation — `/about/` matches `/about` |

---

## `resolveRoute`

| Status | Test |
|--------|------|
| [x] | returns first matching `RouteTarget` with extracted params |
| [x] | returns `null` when no route in list matches pathname |
| [x] | wildcard route `/*` matches any path that doesn't match earlier routes |
| [x] | earlier route wins over later route for the same path (first-match-wins) |

---

## `resolveRemotePage`

| Status | Test |
|--------|------|
| [x] | returns correct lazy-loaded page module for matching subpath |
| [x] | returns `null` when subpath matches no registered page |
| [x] | normalises leading slash: `reports/1` and `/reports/1` match same pattern |
| [x] | extracted params are passed through with lazy load result |

---

## `createRouter` / `dispatchMfjsNavigate`

| Status | Test |
|--------|------|
| [x] | `navigate({ to })` calls `history.pushState` with correct path |
| [x] | `navigate({ to, mode: 'replace' })` calls `history.replaceState` |
| [x] | subscriber callback is invoked immediately with current path on subscribe |
| [x] | subscriber callback is invoked after `navigate()` |
| [x] | `unsubscribe` fn returned from `subscribe()` stops further callbacks |
| [x] | `popstate` browser event triggers subscriber callback |
| [x] | `basePath` option: events only fire when path starts with basePath |
| [x] | `destroy()` removes `popstate` listener and `mfjs:navigate` listener |
| [x] | `dispatchMfjsNavigate({ to })` dispatches `mfjs:navigate` CustomEvent on `window` |
| [x] | shell `mfjs:navigate` listener causes correct remote module to be loaded |

---

## `EventBus`

| Status | Test |
|--------|------|
| [x] | `on` + `emit` — handler receives correct typed payload |
| [x] | `on` — returned cleanup function removes the handler |
| [x] | `emit` — no error thrown when no handlers registered for event |
| [x] | two separate `EventBus` instances do NOT share events |
| [x] | TypeScript: emitting an unknown event key fails at compile time (`tsc --noEmit`) |

---

## CLI — `mfjs routes`

| Status | Test |
|--------|------|
| [x] | scans `src/pages/**` and generates route manifest with correct path patterns |
| [x] | generates host manifest mapping remotes to base paths |
| [x] | `[id].tsx` file name becomes `:id` in route pattern |
| [x] | nested directories produce nested route paths |
| [x] | re-running `mfjs routes` overwrites existing manifest cleanly |

---

## End-to-End (Playwright)

| Status | Test |
|--------|------|
| [x] | basic example — shell loads and remote `./App` mounts without error |
| [x] | basic example — no `Invalid hook call` / `dispatcher is null` error in browser console |
| [x] | basic example — `data-testid="remote-loaded"` element is visible in shell |
| [x] | routing — shell shows Dashboard Home page at `/` |
| [x] | routing — nav to `/dashboard/settings` renders Settings page |
| [x] | routing — nav to `/dashboard/users/1` renders User page with correct id |
| [x] | routing — in-remote `dispatchMfjsNavigate` navigates shell (Home → Settings button) |
| [x] | routing — in-remote `dispatchMfjsNavigate` navigates shell (Home → User #42 button) |
| [x] | routing — Settings back button returns to Dashboard Home |
| [x] | routing — browser back/forward works after client-side navigation |
| [x] | routing — deep-link `/dashboard/settings` loads correct page directly |
| [x] | routing — deep-link `/dashboard/users/7` loads correct page directly |
| [ ] | on-demand compilation — remote is not built until shell first requests it |
| [x] | proxy remoteEntry — shell fetches `remoteEntry.js` via dev-server proxy path |
| [ ] | hot reload — editing `remote.tsx` triggers HMR and shell reflects change without page reload |
| [ ] | production build — shell served statically loads remote from `dist/remoteEntry.js` |
